### Description

I was in love with RushHour since I first saw it. It comes in a little box with puzzle cards and nice little plastic cars and trucks, but it took too long for me to accomodate the cars each time I wanted to play a new puzzle. I then decided to clone this game for the PC. The package comes with all standard 40 levels of the original game, has a solution saver, a puzzle editor, a score routine, supports movements with mouse and with arrow keys, a nice-looking timer (7-segment-displays)... A complete game to excercise your brains.
