Use notepad to make or edit level packs and rename
the file extension from txt to pak so that the program knows
it is a level pack

The very first line contains the number of levels in the pak

Then, you must type in the level number in a consecutive form
in the following format:

-level-

example:

-1-

level number 0 is not allowed

The third line contains the number of cars to load
just plug in a number from 1 to 29

---------
1
-1-
1
---------

number of moves
time limit in seconds

to load a car, first type in the car number.
Car numbers are like characters: For example,
Car 1 is small, red and horizontally positioned

---------
1        This is the number of cars
1        This is the car number to load
---------

The specify the block you want the car to appear
from 1 to 36. take a look at the matrix and decide

	1	2	3	4	5	6
	7	8	9	10	11	12
	13	14	15	16	17	18
	19	20	21	22	23	24
	25	26	27	28	29	30
	31	32	33	34	35	36

If you select block 1 as the position of car 1, which is
horizontally positioned, the car will occupy block 1 and 2

if you select block 1 for a Vertically positioned vehicle
sich vehicle will occupy blocks 1 and 7

----------
1
1
1	  The starting position of the car
----------

There are 4 types of vehicle positions: V2, H2, V3 and H3
V2 stands for a 2-piece vertically positioned vehicle
and so on.

We already said that car numbers are like characters that
have predefined positions. Yes, but you have to plug it
in too just to make sure your script has no errors

so:

----------
1
1
1
H2
----------
means that we will be loading 1 car. Car 1 will be positioned
in block 1 and occupying block 2. Also, to make sure we hace no
errors on our script, we plug in the H2 to say that
the car is Horizontally positioned and occupies 2 blocks even
if the program already knows that car 1 is like we described it
with the last line.
